                            An incredibly basic game engine that uses the power of 2D lists to walk the player through a text-based adventure. You can bring your own story as a .csv file or enjoy the provided demo! Version 1.1 includes an updated save/load system so you never have to worry about losing your progress. I decided to feature this project because I'm proud of the ASCII art I made for the main menu. The app isn't actually deployed anywhere (nor will it be) so you'll have to live with this screenshot instead.<br><br>

                            It does what it says on the tin. Checks for previous budgets, the user can then load one of them or start a new file. The user adds items to the budget, and the program does the math for them. Then they can save the file for future reference.<br><br>

                            A very simple Morse code translator. Error checks input for characters it can't translate, runs the input through the translation, and prints the dits and dahs in the terminal.<br><br>
