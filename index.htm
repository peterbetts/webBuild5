                    I'll be honest here, I tried to come up with something original and entertaining for this section but I'm pretty sick as I work on this project and can't really come up with anything good. My story basically goes like this: I was born in Halifax way back in December of '97. I don't remember 9/11, which (I believe) makes me a zoomer, but my family computer ran Windows 98 until 2010, so you tell me where I land on that.<br><br>I got my bilingual (French/English) high school diploma in 2015, and have been figuring things out ever since. For a while, I wanted to be a professional guitarist, but I honestly never really put the time in. I took a bilingual retail position at a music store in Moncton and pretty quickly learned that I despise retail.<br><br>My next chapter involved a lot of patience. Without getting too far into the weeds, over the course of about 5 years I jumped through a lot of hoops in an attempt to become an air traffic controller. I applied, was interviewed, got hired, started training, was let go, sat around for a year and a half, got rehired, started training again, made it 99% of the way through the training, and was let go again.<br><br>I'll be honest, that really took the wind out of my sails. But now, a new chapter has begun. I've found a new interest in programming, so I figure I might as well pursue it professionally. Here's to a new beginning in a new industry.
